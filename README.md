# Government-Statistics-Website
My first project written with JavaScript. It fetches live data from an API and dynamically builds filterable tables and statistics from JSON data using Vanilla JavaScript functions.

API by ProPublica: https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api

Both house_statistics.js and senate_statistics.js are written in Vue.js.

Features:

- Responsive design
- Accordion elements
- Interactive filters
- Live statistics stored locally and only fetched/updated if local data is older than 30 minutes.
